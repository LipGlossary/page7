Caution: maudlin feels ahead.

I've said it before, but it bears repeating: I was very touched by your parting gift. Upon opening it, I shed every tear I think I ever will for Madison, the theater of so many of my mistakes.

I don't know what it says about my life or the friends I tend to keep, but that box was the sweetest thing anyone's ever done for me. Indeed, it kept me company on the journey, each rediscovered, unexpected object a reminder that our friendship is not nothing. I have to keep telling myself that. I haven't made--couldn't have made you up.

So it was strange talking to you on the phone in the middle of my journey. We'd never established a rapport for these things. And between all the people and the stress of logistics, I've been in survival mode: peppy, but generally unreachable by anything but scraps as the miles melted past.

    Crows circle a lone tree on a desiccated hill.

Perhaps friends are context-dependent. Prying Nate loose has rendered him alien and unsafe.

    The weight of 86 forest fires on already stinging eyes.

Travel makes me intensely internally focused. I'm drowning in the magnitude of scenery. Coversation is like shouting back to a retreating shore.

And so there's a festering between my voodoo daydream and the beta-blockered anxiety that rolls off him like mountain mist. Every time he's in view of the box, he visibly winces. Like he's just realized he already lost something he didn't know he wanted.

But I think the seed of all this started before. Around when I met you. When I started becoming a person again. When I got a good look at everything and wanted to pluck out its eyes and leave it for dead on the curb.

    A man in a studded and painted leather jacket holds a child dressed in pastels and lace. His kilt rides so low you could drop a quarter down the back like a slot machine.

Finally settled, the unsettling feeling continues. Over the years he has adopted manerisms from "Muppet Lulu", my silly side that I imagine I would inhabit were I flocked with purple fuzz and lacked arm bones. But to see this reflected back at me when I'm not in the mood (which is 95% of the time) is intensely irritating.

    The Costco air conditioning salesman is a time traveler from the 1980s. He lounges against the unit and smiles a smile meant for suckers from behind the distortion of thick wire-rimmed glasses. His combover flutters in the well-conditioned air like the faded neon streamers.

In Idaho the mindset shifted abruptly from "road trip" to "your new home region of the world" which makes being here with something familiar (i.e. Nate) very wrong, rather than comforting.

    Home is where I go when I don't want to pretend to be human anymore.

But I don't feel home yet and I couldn't say why that is. I struggle to remember whether or not Vancouver ever felt like home, but my instinct is that it didn't.

But every morning is beautiful, everyone is friendly, there are furs in the second-hand shops, and that's good enough.

I know I need to find some real friends here. I want that tethered, accountable feeling. It's about time we had some belonging.

The first few weeks, I really gave it a go.

But peering through the pinhole of depression, it's impossible to see why the hell any of that would matter to anybody.

Waking and showering and arming myself with coffee and shuffling to the office only because if I don't, everything gets so much worse. Textureless.

And maybe that's why I've worked so much the past couple of years. Prior to this I was consumed by school. I don't necessarily want to be, but I clearly have to be busy, and on someone else's schedule in order to remain accountable.

Head down in code, the hours melt away and I feel simultaneously accomplished and worn-out, like good exercise. It's easy, then, to read a book and not feel guilty about it.

You see, discipline is not something I have naturally. It must be inflicted.

My quest, I suppose, is to find a happy victimizer.

    A palimpsest is a wonderful use of unwanted pages. But the things I could say to you could not possibly fit on a single leaf. I'd need a book.

Where the puzzle may not be expertly crafted, and the reveal may be apparent a mile off. But we learned that sometimes the adventure is worth the trouble if the narrative is compelling and the pace of the game can add that frisson of engagement.

Another unfamiliar ceiling.

But it's not like I crave the familiar. That eerie, deja vu sense of running in place. No.

Routine and good habits are my bread and water, but we don't live for bread and water. I feel like I live to spite them, hungering for the novel.

That heart-fluttering, white-hot obssession. Consuming as it consumes. Addicted until one burns the other out.

Strange attractors.

I had hoped to leave none behind in Madison. Sucked dry. Nothing at all to tether me there.

---

Not that I hold it against you. It's you who are in the wrong place. ;)

---

I wonder, are these relationships with the world inherently unsustainable? Am I a poor steward of the universe? Holding probability waves open just so I can exploit them, siphon off the frisson of potential.

---

And so we attempt to convert face-to-face capital into a rapport that can withstand distance and transcend communication media.

I'm trying to get better at the telephone, but, in terms of expression, I'm not what you would call verbal. I'm much more comfortable with the written word.

That said, comfort is not always what we want.

And rarely what we need.

---

Lately I've been ruminating on the dichotomy between wants and needs. One that lies beyond the stereotypical ideas, of course.

(What you never want is never what's best for you.)

(Or: what you really need is the last thing you'd want.)

Those observations are cute, but I think the mismatch is actually rooted in dishonesty. Within and without.

We can't help but be honest about our needs. Our close friends must see them plainly, or they wouldn't have so much unsolicited advice about what to do with ourselves.

But what our friends can't advise is what we SHOULD want.

---

Aside from it sounding absurd, how could they? When very few people seem to acually know what it is they want.

I think that's the defining feature of someone I observe to have an apparent "inner life". Their wants are a known quantity, at least within themselves.

And yet these people are often more obscure. They play their hands close.

Clearly, wanting something, whether you know what it is or not, is terrifying.

But how is it that holding a want, exposing a want, is more frightening than doing the same with a need? How would a want make you any measure more vulnerable when needs are, by definition, necessary for continued health, life, etc.?

---

I would posit that we don't get to choose our wants.
But maybe we've convinced ourselves that we can,
thus rendering all our selfishly held wants into soft targets and agents of shame.

Because we want to want our wants.

Delicious self-indulgence.

No one can begrudge me my needs.
If they try, I can be indignant and self-righteous and assertive.

But if you sneer at my wants, you sneer at my secret self.
At my literal
<i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.

And if that want hinges on something within your agency...

Something that would be spoiled if not given freely...

Well, I can see how some people could find that vulnerability--
that exposure to chance, that collapsing of potential--
a risk not worth taking.

Especially when the purpose of the want was to want it,
not to have it.

That's all well and good for fiction and games
(and oh, how I love a good game of romance),
but life's too fleeting and true connection too precious for such delicious nonsense.

---

One could subsist on fiction as easily as one would on candy.
And yet, I'm sure I've attempted both.

---

I don't think all that wish-fulfillment fiction is really about wish-fulfillment.
It's about wish-exposure.

Even those suffering unrequited wants live fuller, more feeling lives
than those who will not own
(or even learn)
their desires.

---

Here's to big feelings
and a life exposed to the elements.

### Devices and Desires

Valens reached out slowly toward the letter on the table, like the fencer in First advancing on an opponent of unknown capacity. This might, after all, be the letter that said there would be no more letters, and until he'd looked and seen that it wasn't, he daren't lower his guard to Third and engage with the actual text. His fingers made contact, gentle as the first pressure of blade on blade as the fencers gauge each other by feel at the narrow distance. Applying and minute amount of force through the pad of his middle finger, he drew it toward him until his hand could close around it. Then he paused, because the next movement would draw him into an irrevocable moment. He was a brave man (he wasn't proud of his courage; he simply acknowledged it) and he was afraid. Gentle and progressive as the clean loose of an arrow, he slid his finger under the fold and prised upward against the seal until the brittle wax burst. The parchment slowly relaxed, the way a body does the moment after death. He unfolded the letter.

#### 120
This isn't love, Valens told himself. He knew about love, having seen it at work among his friends and people around him. Love was altogether more predatory. It was concerned with pursuit, capture,enjoyment; it was caused by beauty, the way raw red skin is caused by the sun; it was an appetitie, like hunger or thinrst, a physical discomforrt that tortured you until it was satisfied. That, he knew from her letters, was how she felt aobut Orsea--how they feld about each other--and so this couldn't be love, in which case it could only be friendship; shared interest, an instructive comparison of perspectives, a meeting of minds, a pooling of resources. (She'd said in a letter that he seemed to go through life like one of the angents sent by the trading companies to observe foreign countries and report back, with details of manners and customs, geography and society, that might come in handy for future operations; who did he report to? she wondered. He'd been surprised at that. Surely she would ahve guessed.) Not love, obviously. Different. Better...

#### 120
He read the letter through three more times; on the second and third readings he made notes on a piece of paper. That in itself was more evidence, because who makes notes for a alove letter? He'd seen plenty of htem and htey were all the same, all earth, air, fire and water; was it his imagination, or could nobody, no matter how clever, write a love letter with out coming ac ross as slightly ridiculous? No, yo umade notes for a meeting, a lecture, an essay, a sermon, a dissertation. That was more like it; he and she were the only two members of a learned society, a college of philosophers and scientists observing the world, publishing their results to each other, occasionally discussing a dsisputed conclusion in the interests of pure truth. He'd met people like that; they wrote letters to colleagues they'd never met, or once only for a few minutes at some function, and often their shared correspondence would last for years, a life time, until one day some acquaintance mentioned that so-and-so had died (in his sleep, advanced old age), thereby
##### 121
explaining a longer than usual interval between letter and reply. If it was love, he'dl ong ago have sent for his marshals and generals, invaded Eremia, stuck Orsea's head up on a pike and brought her back home as a great and marvelous prize; or he'd have climbed the castle wal, in the middle of hte night and stolen her away with rope ladders and relays of horses ready and waiting at carefully planned stages; or, having considered the strategic position and reached the conclusion that the venture was impractical, he'd have given it up and fallen in love with someone else.

#### 124
Once she'd gone, however, the world changed. The brief flurry of activity, the tremendous draining effort of concentration, the feeling of being alive, all faded away so quickly that he wondered if it had been a dream. But he knew the feeling too well for that. It was the same at the bow-and-stable, or the lowly off-season hunts, where you sit and wait, and nothing happens; where you perch in your high-seat or cower in your hide, waiting for the wild and elusive quarry that is under no obligation to come to you, until it's too dark or too wet, and you go home. While you wait there, impatient and resigned as a lover waiting for a letter, your mind detaches, you can for a little while be someone completely different, and believe that the stranger is really you. It's only when you see the flicker of momvement or hear the muffled, inhuman cough that the real you comes skittering back, panicked and eager and suddenly wide awake, and at once the bow is back in your hands, the arrow is notched, cockfeather out, and the world is small and sharp once again.
